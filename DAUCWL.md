# Prior Art Good-faith Triad:
0. This work or software wasn't all created
by the above-designated artists. It uses
prior art that may include other parties'
creative output or software dependencies.
Where it uses such prior art, it does,
intends to, and will do so in accordance with
the licensing terms of that prior art.

0. Other parties may use these artists'
contributions. When they do so, they have
_freedom to choose_ to do so as they wish.
By doing so, they inherently accept the sole
responsibility for all outcomes.

0. When other parties use the other works or
source works that these artists used,
they have the responsibility to do so in
accordance with any applicable or intended
licenses therein.

--------------------------------------------
# Artists' and User-audiences' Good-faith Triad:
0. These artists will neither
    + delete,
    + erase,
    + modify, nor
    + obfuscate
  the terms of any _OTHER_ license contained
  in any source work that they use. 

0. These artists' contributions
to these works
    + Obligate user-audiences, including you, in
    no way to these artists,
    + Obligate these artists to fulfill no
    responsibilities apart from those
    explicitly specified in the terms of
    this license and others associated
    with any source works that this work uses,
    contains or duplicates, and
    + Come with neither explicit nor implied
      - assurances,
      - contracts, nor
      - guarantees in any form.

0. When these artists use
    + software dependencies,
    + other works,
    + prior works, or
    + source works,
these artists will work to keep them
updated in files made publicly available in
the same location as the works this license
pertains to, such as in a top-level file
named `package.json`.
