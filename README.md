# LICENSE

These are some license terms. They do different things that some other licenses
may not.

## DAUCWL.md
This license focuses specifically on general creative works with an emphasis on
acknowledging prior art, keeping artists from being beholden to audiences or
users, and establishing very permissive future usage allowances.

All other licenses contained in this repository are released under the terms of 
DAUCWL.md.
